**Frequency Options**
- **Monthly**: Standard. Higher drift risk.
- **Quarterly**: 2% discount.
- **Annual**: 8% discount. Best for retention.

**Hardship Plans**
- If a customer cannot pay the full catch-up amount:
  - Offer **split payments** (50% now, 50% in 15 days) to stay active.
  - *Constraint*: Cannot split the first month's premium of a new term.

**Autopay Incentives**
- Moving from Manual to Autopay reduces lapse risk by 40%.
- Offer: "Set up Autopay today and we'll waive the late fee for this month."
