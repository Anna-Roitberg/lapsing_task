# [Doc5] Seasonality & Smoker Coaching

**Seasonality**
- **January/February**: High lapse risk (Post-holiday budget crunch).
  - *Strategy*: Soft touch reminders, emphasize tax refund planning for annual payments.
- **Summer**: High claims (Travel) + standard payments.

**Smoker Coaching (Life/Health)**
- Customers rated as Smokers pay significantly higher premiums.
- **Offer**: "Join our Cessation Program. If you remain smoke-free for 12 months, we will re-rate your policy to Non-Smoker rates."
- **Impact**: Reduces premium by ~20-30%, increasing retention.
